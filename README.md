### Dios salve al bufon
I participated in the Global Game Jam 2024, where I created a game in 48 hours. The game is called "Dios salve al bufon" and it is about being a king who receives guests at his castle. The jester tells a joke and you have three options: laugh, be neutral, or get angry. Depending on your choice, the guest will react differently lowering the relationship with that faction. The game is a comedy-adventure game with multiple endings and funny dialogues. I used Unty, C#, to make the game. You can check it out here: \
