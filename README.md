### Dios salve al bufon
I participated in the Global Game Jam 2024, where I created a game in 48 hours. The game is called "Dios salve al bufon" and it is about being a king who receives guests at his castle. The jester tells a joke and you have three options: laugh, be neutral, or get angry. Depending on your choice, the guest will react differently lowering the relationship with that faction. The game is a comedy-adventure game with multiple endings and funny dialogues. I used Unty, C#, to make the game. You can check it out here: \

### VR Playground
I am working on a project that aims to create a copy of Beat Saber, a VR rhythm game, in Unreal Engine. My project is still in progress, but I have already implemented some basic features. For example, I have created a system that spawns cubes with different directions  The player has to use two VR controllers to cut the cubes with the correct orientation and timing. Each successful cut gives the player some points, while each missed or wrong cut reduces the player's health. My goal is to create a fun and immersive game that challenges the player's reflexes and coordination.

### Tom Looman Professional Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine course
I took an Unreal Engine C++ course called "Professional Game Development in C++ and Unreal Engine". I learned how to create a third-person action game from scratch using C++ and Unreal Engine. The course taught me the essential concepts and techniques of C++ programming within the Unreal Engine environment. The course also focused on best practices and building a solid framework for professional game development. \
